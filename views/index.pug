      p.lead Friends of Sonning Common Library (FoSCL) exists to promote and support the library by providing it with resources and by working for the continuation of an effective library service. 
      p Cuts to the library budgets have threatened libraries throughout the UK. Sonning Common Library is amongst many smaller libraries that are now supported by volunteers and the activities of a Friends Group.

      p First set up in 1998, the Friends Group has helped fight two successful campaigns to save the library â€“ the most recent in 2010/11. Since August 2014 our team of volunteers have supported the professional staff by, among other things, shelving books, running story-times, helping customers use the self-service machines and delivering books to people in the community. 
      p FoSCL also raises additional funds to replace the shortfall created by County Council budget cuts. Our main sources of funds are membership fees and donations. As a charity we are able to reclaim tax on individual donations through gift-aid.
      p FoSCL is managed by an Executive Committee elected by the members at its Annual General Meeting.  A copy of our #[a(href='download/constitution') constitution can be downloaded] or viewed in the library.
