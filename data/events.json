The theme this year is 'Space Chase' and we had a very good take up. The SRC readers were encouraged by our very enthusiastic young helpers and the Library noticeboard is full of avatars moving towards the finish line...</p><p> We don’t want adults to miss out on reading challenges. There is still time to enter the Oxfordshire County Library Service’s Oxfordshire Reads competition. The <b>closing date is 7th September</b>. Just pick up a postcard from the Library and fill it in with your best reads and you will be entered into the fantastic prize draw. To make it even more interesting, our wonderful Library staff have organised a blind choice by wrapping a selection of books. Take a chance and enter the competition!</p><img src='/images/wrapped-book.jpg' alt='Picture of a wrapped book'/>"
